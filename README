Erlang Services Platform (erlang/SP)

Erlang/SP is a replacement for erlang/OTP that is designed to scale to 10Ks of processors. OTP allows a designer to architect distributed systems out of single process behaviours to create scaffoldings in the 10-100s of process range geared around a single permanent hierarchical application or a set of single hierarchical applications. SP eschews applications in favor of peer services that replicate and fade as needed, constructing solutions on an architecture functionally composed with patterns of Cooperating Processes.
